# GRC Transition Guide: Security Analyst to GRC Engineer

## Understanding the Shift

As a security analyst with 11 years of experience, you already have the foundation for GRC roles. The key is **reframing your experience** to emphasize governance, risk management, and compliance aspects rather than purely technical security operations.

## Common Reasons for Rejection (Even When Qualified)

1. **Resume uses security-focused language instead of GRC terminology**
   - ❌ "Monitored SIEM alerts"
   - ✅ "Conducted continuous control monitoring and risk assessment using SIEM data"

2. **Missing framework keywords that ATS systems scan for**
   - Add: NIST CSF, ISO 27001, SOX, PCI DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP
   - Even if your work touched these indirectly, mention them

3. **Achievements focus on technical tasks vs. business outcomes**
   - ❌ "Configured firewall rules"
   - ✅ "Implemented network security controls aligned with NIST 800-53, reducing risk exposure by 45%"

4. **Missing GRC-specific tools and platforms**
   - Archer, ServiceNow GRC, RSAM, OnSpring, Vanta, SecureFrame
   - If you haven't used these, mention similar tools: "Experience with compliance tracking platforms and risk registers"

## How to Reframe Your Security Experience

### Example 1: Vulnerability Management → Risk Management

**Before (Security Analyst):**
> Performed quarterly vulnerability scans using Nessus and Qualys. Remediated critical findings within SLA.

**After (GRC Engineer):**
> Managed enterprise-wide vulnerability risk assessment program, identifying and prioritizing remediation of 500+ vulnerabilities quarterly. Collaborated with IT teams to ensure 98% compliance with risk acceptance policies and reduced critical findings by 60% year-over-year.

**Why it works:** Emphasizes risk management, compliance, metrics, and cross-functional collaboration.

---

### Example 2: Security Monitoring → Compliance Monitoring

**Before:**
> Monitored security events in Splunk. Investigated incidents and created reports.

**After:**
> Conducted continuous compliance monitoring using SIEM analytics to validate security control effectiveness. Produced monthly compliance reports for audit committees, demonstrating 95% control adherence across NIST 800-53 and ISO 27001 frameworks.

**Why it works:** Connects technical work to compliance frameworks and governance reporting.

---

### Example 3: Policy Updates → Governance

**Before:**
> Updated security policies and procedures as needed.

**After:**
> Led governance initiatives to develop and maintain 25+ security policies and procedures aligned with NIST CSF, ISO 27001, and SOX requirements. Conducted annual policy reviews with legal and compliance teams, ensuring regulatory alignment and reducing audit exceptions by 40%.

**Why it works:** Shows leadership, framework alignment, cross-functional work, and measurable impact.

---

### Example 4: Audit Support → Audit Management

**Before:**
> Provided evidence for annual SOX audit.

**After:**
> Managed SOX IT general controls (ITGC) audit process, coordinating evidence collection across 15 business units. Implemented control testing procedures that reduced audit preparation time by 50% and achieved zero material weaknesses for three consecutive years.

**Why it works:** Demonstrates audit program management, not just participation.
