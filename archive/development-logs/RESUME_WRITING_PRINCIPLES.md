# GRC Resume Writing Principles
## The Signal-Over-Biography Framework

---

## 1. The Resume Isn't a Biography, It's a Signal

### The Reality
Hiring managers spend **7-10 seconds** on a first pass of your resume. That's it.

### Your Goal
Send the right signal in that short window. Every line should make the reader think:
> **"This person can solve my problem."**

### What This Means
- ❌ Don't tell your entire career story
- ✅ Focus each bullet on clarity, alignment, and measurable impact
- ✅ Make it scannable and outcome-focused
- ✅ Lead with what matters most to THEM, not you

### Example Transformation

**Before (Biography):**
> Worked in cybersecurity for 10 years across various federal agencies. Handled vulnerability management, compliance, and security assessments. Responsible for ensuring systems met NIST requirements.

**After (Signal):**
> GRC Engineer | Reduced vulnerabilities 83% across 10,000+ assets | Automated NIST RMF compliance using AWS Config & Python | Active Secret Clearance

## 2. Lead With Your Top 3 Wins

### The Wins That Define You
Identify the **three achievements** you should never downplay or bury. These become your anchors.

### Jonathan's Top 3 Wins:
1. **Reduced vulnerabilities from 70,000 → 12,000** (83% reduction)
2. **Automated compliance workflows** reducing documentation cycles by 70%
3. **Built AWS-native continuous compliance pipelines** for real-time evidence collection

### Where to Place Them
- **Roadmap of Impact section** (top of resume)
- **First bullets** in current role
- **Professional summary**
- **LinkedIn headline**

### Why This Works
Creates immediate credibility. The reader knows within 10 seconds that you deliver results.

## 3. Shift from Responsibilities to Outcomes

### The Biggest Difference
**Solid resume:** Lists what you were responsible for  
**Great resume:** Shows what you accomplished

### The Formula

```
[Action Verb] + [Measurable Outcome] + [Scope] + [Method/Tool]
```

### Examples

**❌ Responsibility-Focused:**
> Responsible for leading vulnerability management efforts across the enterprise.

**✅ Outcome-Focused:**
> Reduced open vulnerabilities by 78% across 10,000+ assets through automated remediation workflows.

---

**❌ Responsibility-Focused:**
> Managed compliance documentation for multiple frameworks.

**✅ Outcome-Focused:**
> Automated SSP→OSCAL→ARCAMPE conversion workflows, reducing documentation cycles by 70% and improving audit accuracy.

---

**❌ Responsibility-Focused:**
> Conducted security assessments for federal systems.

**✅ Outcome-Focused:**
> Led NIST RMF assessments for MD THINK and MD Benefits, achieving 90%+ CIS/STIG compliance across 7,500+ cloud assets.

### The Pattern
Every bullet should answer:
1. **What did you do?** (Action)
2. **What was the result?** (Outcome)
3. **How big was it?** (Scope)
4. **How did you do it?** (Method)

---

## 4. Show the Evolution: Governance → Engineering

### The Shift
- **Governance** = what needs to happen (policies, frameworks, requirements)
- **Engineering** = how it gets done (automation, tools, implementation)

### For GRC Engineer Roles
Your resume should show you understand BOTH and can bridge the gap.

### How to Show This

**Traditional GRC (Governance):**
> Ensured compliance with NIST 800-53 controls through quarterly assessments and POA&M tracking.

**GRC Engineering (How It Gets Done):**
> Built AWS Config rules to continuously validate NIST 800-53 controls, replacing quarterly manual reviews with real-time automated compliance monitoring.

### Signal Forward Momentum

Add a line like:
> Currently expanding AWS Cloud and Python automation skills to enhance control monitoring and evidence collection capabilities.

**Why this works:**
- Shows you're learning
- Signals technical curiosity
- Demonstrates growth mindset
- Positions you as future-focused

## 5. Cut the Fluff: Length Guidelines

### The Problem
Federal/government resumes often stretch beyond 5 pages. Private sector doesn't work that way.

### The Rules

**1 Page:**
- Early career (0-3 years)
- First GRC role
- Career changers

**2 Pages:**
- Mid-career (4-10 years) ← **This is you**
- Measurable results to show
- Multiple relevant roles

**3 Pages (MAXIMUM):**
- Senior professionals (10+ years)
- Hybrid leadership roles
- Multiple specializations

### Your Current Resume
At 10+ years, **2 pages is ideal**. Every extra paragraph risks losing focus.

### What to Cut
- ❌ Duties everyone in the role does
- ❌ Old technology no longer relevant
- ❌ Roles from 15+ years ago (unless highly relevant)
- ❌ Obvious statements ("Attended meetings")
- ❌ Soft skills without proof ("Team player")

### What to Keep
- ✅ Quantified achievements
- ✅ Relevant frameworks and tools
- ✅ Automation and engineering work
- ✅ Federal experience (with clearance)
- ✅ Recent certifications

## 6. Align Keywords With Your Target Role

### The Dual Scan
Your resume gets scanned by:
1. **ATS systems** (looking for exact keyword matches)
2. **Recruiters** (looking for relevant experience)

### How to Find Keywords
1. Read the job posting carefully
2. Note repeated terms and requirements
3. Check "Required Qualifications" section
4. Look at "Preferred Skills"

### Common GRC Keywords

**Frameworks:**
- ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, NIST RMF
- PCI DSS, HIPAA, FedRAMP, FISMA
- GDPR, CCPA, CIS Controls

**Activities:**
- Risk assessment, control testing, gap analysis
- Audit readiness, compliance monitoring
- Vulnerability management, remediation tracking
- Policy development, documentation

**Tools:**
- AWS (Config, Lambda, Security Hub)
- Python, automation, scripting
- ServiceNow GRC, Archer, CSAM
- Qualys, Tenable, Wiz, CrowdStrike

**Engineering:**
- CI/CD, DevSecOps, infrastructure as code
- SIEM, log analysis, continuous monitoring
- API integration, workflow automation

### Where to Insert Keywords

**Best Places:**
1. **Skills section** - Natural keyword repository
2. **Project bullets** - "Built Python automation for..."
3. **Achievement bullets** - "Achieved SOC 2 compliance..."
4. **Professional summary** - "Experienced in NIST RMF, FedRAMP..."

**Don't:**
- ❌ Keyword stuff (looks obvious)
- ❌ Claim experience you don't have
- ❌ Use acronyms without spelling them out once
- ❌ Hide keywords in white text (ATS detects this)

---

## 7. Don't Hide Your Personality or Projects

### Why This Matters
Real projects separate **GRC Engineers** from **checkbox auditors**.

### What to Include

**Personal Projects:**
- AWS Config → Jira automation
- Vulnerability metrics dashboard
- SSP→OSCAL conversion pipeline
- Control harmonization framework

**Online Presence:**
- Website: securitybyjp.com ✅
- GitHub repositories
- Technical blog posts
- Conference talks or presentations

**Learning Path:**
- Recent certifications (CAISS, TAISE)
- Training in progress
- Labs or home environments
- Open source contributions

### Where to Put It

**On Resume:**
- "Featured Projects" section
- Link in header (securitybyjp.com)
- Certifications section (shows continuous learning)

**On LinkedIn:**
- Featured section
- About section
- Publications/Projects
- Certifications with dates

### Personal Headline Examples

**Good:**
> GRC Engineer focused on automation, AWS compliance, and evidence collection efficiency

**Better:**
> GRC Engineer | Automating Compliance at Scale | AWS + Python + NIST RMF

**Best (Specific to Role):**
> GRC Engineer | Reduced Vulnerabilities 83% Through Automation | AWS Cloud Security | Active Secret Clearance

## 8. Your Resume is Your First Engineering Deliverable

### What Your Resume Proves

A well-crafted resume demonstrates you can:

1. **Communicate complex work clearly**
   - Technical details → Business value
   - Jargon → Plain language
   - Processes → Outcomes

2. **Deliver measurable outcomes**
   - Not just "did things"
   - Quantified results
   - Business impact

3. **Bring precision to the organization**

## The Bottom Line

**Your resume isn't about you. It's about them.**

Every line should answer the hiring manager's question:
> "Can this person solve my problem?"

When you frame your experience as outcomes, lead with wins, and show the evolution from governance to engineering, the answer becomes obvious:

> **"Yes. And they have the track record to prove it."**

That's when you get the interview.
