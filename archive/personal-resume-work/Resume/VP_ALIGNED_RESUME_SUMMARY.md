## Job Title Recommendation

### **Question:** Should I change "Senior Cybersecurity Specialist" to "GRC Engineer"?

### **Answer:** Use BOTH (as done in new resume)

**Format:**
```
GRC Engineer / Senior Cybersecurity Specialist
```

**Why this works:**
1. **GRC Engineer** = What you do (engineering focus)
2. **Senior Cybersecurity Specialist** = Official title (accuracy)
3. **Both** = Best of both worlds

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Resonates with "GRC Engineer" job postings
- ✅ Shows engineering mindset
- ✅ Keeps official title for verification
- ✅ Positions you for technical roles
- ✅ Maintains honesty

**Alternative options:**
- "GRC Engineer" only - Less accurate to official title
- "Senior Cybersecurity Specialist" only - Doesn't show GRC focus
- "GRC Engineer / Senior Cybersecurity Specialist" - ⭐ BEST
