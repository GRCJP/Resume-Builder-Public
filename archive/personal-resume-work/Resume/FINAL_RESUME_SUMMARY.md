## 🔑 Key Changes from Original Resume

### **Header**
**Before:**
```
JONATHAN L. PEREZ, MS, CISSP, CISM
Active Secret Clearance
Aldie, VA | 703-843-6887 | jleepe@outlook.com
```

JONATHAN L. PEREZ, MS, CISSP, CISM
Bridging GRC and Engineering to automate compliance at scale
Aldie, VA | 703-843-6887 | jleepe@outlook.com | linkedin.com/in/cyberjp | securitybyjp.com
Active Secret Clearance
```

**Why:** Immediate positioning as GRC Engineer, not just analyst

---

### **Professional Summary**
**Before (Original):**
> Diligent and adaptable cybersecurity and risk management professional with over 10 years of experience overseeing the security posture of cloud and on-premises systems...

**Before (ChatGPT):**
> Cloud-focused GRC Engineer and Senior Assessor with 10+ years of experience spanning NIST RMF, FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001...

**After (FINAL):**
> GRC Engineer leveraging AWS Config, Lambda, EventBridge, and Security Hub to automate continuous compliance and evidence collection across hybrid cloud environments. 10+ years bridging NIST RMF, FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001, and PCI DSS governance with engineering execution using Wiz, Qualys, Tenable, and Python automation. Proven track record reducing vulnerabilities 83% and cutting documentation cycles 70% through control automation and risk register integration.

**Why:** 
- Leads with specific AWS tools (VP feedback)
- Emphasizes "continuous compliance" and "evidence collection" (ATS keywords)
- Shows "bridging" governance + engineering (VP's key theme)
- Includes top metrics immediately

> Drive vulnerability reporting workflows using Qualys, Tenable, and Wiz

**After:**
> Lead enterprise vulnerability management program across 10,000+ assets, integrating Wiz, Qualys, and Tenable with Jira and ServiceNow for automated remediation tracking, reducing vulnerabilities from 70,000 to 12,000 (83% reduction)

**Why:** Scope + outcome + method + metric

---

**Before:**
