ROADMAP OF IMPACT
Reduced enterprise vulnerabilities from 70,000 → 12,000 across 10,000+ assets through automated prioritization and remediation workflows.
Engineered continuous compliance pipelines using AWS Config, Lambda, EventBridge, and Security Hub to automatically collect evidence and detect drift.
Automated SSP→OSCAL→ARCAMPE documentation workflows, reducing manual cycles by 70% and improving audit accuracy.
Built a vulnerability → POA&M automation engine ingesting Wiz/Qualys/Tenable outputs, cutting manual review hours by 30%.
Improved CIS/STIG compliance to 90%+ across 7,500+ cloud assets (MD THINK/MD Benefits).
Delivered ISSO enablement programs reducing artifact submission errors by 40% through improved workflows and training.
SUMMARY
Cloud-focused GRC Engineer and Senior Assessor with 10+ years of experience spanning NIST RMF, FedRAMP, SOC 2, ISO 27001, and continuous monitoring across Federal and State environments. I merge ISSO-level governance with engineering execution to automate evidence collection, strengthen vulnerability reduction, and implement AWS-native compliance workflows.
Experienced in RMF/FedRAMP packages, vulnerability analytics, CI/CD validation, SIEM evidence review, and risk register automation. Proven track record delivering measurable improvements in audit readiness, compliance efficiency, and remediation velocity.

PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
Assurit — Senior Cybersecurity Specialist / Deputy Project Manager
2018 – Present | Washington, D.C.
Reduced vulnerabilities from 70,000 → 12,000 across 10,000+ assets by engineering automated remediation routing, prioritization logic, and control-mapped workflows.
Automated RMF evidence pipelines by transforming Wiz/Qualys/Tenable data into normalized, control-mapped findings, reducing manual review time 30%.
Built AWS-native continuous compliance pipelines using Config, Lambda, EventBridge, and Security Hub to detect drift, collect evidence, and sync findings to Jira/ServiceNow.
Led assessments for MD THINK/MD Benefits, FEC, and USPTO, covering NIST RMF, 800-53/171, FedRAMP, ISO 27001, SOC 2, IRS Pub 1075, CMS ARCAMPE.
Engineered SSP→OSCAL→ARCAMPE workflows using Python and RegScale, reducing documentation cycles 70% and improving traceability.
Validated CI/CD pipeline controls (ECR scanning, Wiz SCA, SSM patching) and aligned build processes with NIST 800-53 and FedRAMP baseline requirements.
Performed SIEM analysis leveraging Security Hub, GuardDuty, and Splunk to validate detection controls, triage audit-relevant events, and support IR documentation.
Designed Jira-based risk register automation improving scoring, tracking, and continuous monitoring updates.
Delivered ISSO enablement programs that improved artifact quality and reduced submission errors by 40%.
Selected Achievements
Improved CIS/STIG compliance to 90%+ for 7,500+ cloud assets.
Reduced critical vulnerabilities by 65% in one quarter at MD DHS.
Implemented AWS drift detection workflows that cut control validation time by weeks per cycle.
USPTO / SEC / DHS (Various Contractors) — ISSO / Senior Security Analyst
2014 – 2018 | Washington, D.C.
Performed full RMF lifecycle activities (SSP, SAR, POA&M, SIA, PIA/PTA) across multiple federal systems.
Conducted code-embedded security reviews, reducing release-blocking vulnerabilities for SEC development teams.
Performed VM scanning and configuration analysis across UNIX, Cisco, and Windows, reducing false positives 25%.
Maintained CSAM risk registers, updated mitigation plans, and increased remediation tracking accuracy.
Supported SOC 2 and ISO 27001 evidence collection and technical mapping.
Strengthened IR readiness by correlating SIEM logs with endpoint and cloud telemetry for audit verification.
Selected Achievements
Designed automated scanning workflows that reduced analysis times by ~20%.
Implemented reporting structures improving audit readiness across multiple systems.
FEATURED PROJECTS
AWS Config → Jira Risk Register Automation (Prototype)
Built a Config/Lambda/EventBridge workflow to detect drift, parse findings, and push structured events into Jira for continuous compliance tracking.
Vulnerability Metrics Automation Engine
Developed Python scripts to normalize Wiz/Qualys/Tenable exports and generate MTTR, aging, and exposure dashboards.
SSP→OSCAL→ARCAMPE Conversion Pipeline
Automated documentation workflows reducing SSP update cycles by 70% and increasing artifact consistency.
Control Harmonization Framework
Mapped NIST 800-53, SOC 2, ISO 27001, IRS Pub 1075, and CMS ARCAMPE to unify controls, evidence paths, and narratives.
