# Quick Start Guide - GRC Resume Builder

## What I've Built for You

A specialized resume builder that helps you transition from Security Analyst to GRC Engineer by:

1. **Analyzing job descriptions** to show exactly what keywords you need
2. **Scoring your resume** against real GRC job requirements
3. **Providing human-readable suggestions** that bypass AI detectors
4. **Highlighting missing keywords** so you know what to add
5. **Generating ATS-optimized PDFs** ready to submit

## How to Use It Right Now

### Step 1: Open the Application
The app is running at http://localhost:3000

You should see:
- **Job Description Analyzer** at the top (paste job descriptions here)
- **Resume Form** on the left (fill in your information)
- **Live Preview** on the right (see your resume in real-time)
- **ATS Checker** below the preview (see your compatibility score)

### Step 2: Test the Job Analyzer

1. Open `SAMPLE_GRC_JOB.md` in this folder
2. Copy one of the sample job descriptions
3. Paste it into the "Job Description" box
4. Click "Analyze Job Match"

You'll see:
- **Match Score** (how well your current resume matches)
- **Key Requirements Found** (green badges)
- **Missing Keywords** (orange badges)
- **Tailored Recommendations** (specific suggestions in natural language)

### Step 3: Build Your Resume

Fill in the form with your information. Use the examples from:
- `GRC_TRANSITION_GUIDE.md` - How to reframe security work as GRC
- `HUMAN_READABLE_EXAMPLES.md` - Natural writing that avoids AI detection

**Pro tip:** Start with your professional summary, then add one job at a time.

### Step 4: Optimize Based on Job Analysis

After analyzing a job description:
1. Look at the **Missing Keywords** section
2. Review the **Tailored Recommendations**
3. Update your resume bullets to include relevant keywords
4. Re-analyze to see your improved score

### Step 5: Download Your Resume

Click "Download PDF" to get an ATS-friendly PDF ready to submit.

## Next Steps for You

### Upload Your Current Resumes

I need to see both versions to give you specific feedback:
1. Your old GRC resume
2. The ChatGPT-updated version

Once you upload them, I can:
- Compare them side-by-side
- Identify what's working and what's not
- Show you exactly what to change
- Help you merge the best parts of both

### Find Real Job Descriptions

Go to LinkedIn or Indeed and find 2-3 GRC roles you want to apply for. Paste them into the analyzer to see:
- What keywords you're missing
- How to tailor your resume for each role
- Your match score before and after updates

### Customize the Tool

If you need specific features added, let me know:
- Different frameworks to detect
- Additional GRC tools
- Industry-specific keywords
- Custom suggestion templates

## Common Questions

**Q: Will this work for all GRC roles?**
A: Yes, it's optimized for GRC Analyst, GRC Engineer, and GRC Program Manager roles. The keyword detection covers all major frameworks.

**Q: How do I avoid AI detection?**
A: Use the examples in `HUMAN_READABLE_EXAMPLES.md`. The key is being specific, using numbers, and writing naturally.

**Q: What if I don't have experience with a framework the job requires?**
A: Don't lie. Instead, mention related work. Example: "While not formally certified in ISO 27001, documented 50+ security controls aligned with ISO standards for internal audit."

**Q: How high should my match score be?**
A: Aim for 70%+ for roles you're qualified for. 80%+ is excellent. Below 50% means you need to add more relevant keywords.

**Q: Can I save my resume in the tool?**
A: Currently, the data is stored in your browser. Download the PDF and keep your information in a document. I can add a save/load feature if needed.

## Troubleshooting

**The analyzer says 0% match:**
- Make sure you filled in your resume information first
- Check that you pasted the full job description
- Try one of the sample jobs to test

**My ATS score is low:**
- Fill in all sections (Personal Info, Summary, Experience, Education, Skills)
- Add quantifiable achievements with numbers
- Include action verbs in your bullets
- Add relevant certifications (even if "In Progress")

**The suggestions sound too generic:**
- The suggestions are based on what's missing from your resume
- Fill in more of your actual experience first
- Then re-analyze for more specific recommendations

- ✅ Focuses specifically on GRC roles
