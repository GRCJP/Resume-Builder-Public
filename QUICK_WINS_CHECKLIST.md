## ✅ The 7-Second Test

**Open your resume. Set a timer for 7 seconds. Look away.**

Can you answer these questions?
- [ ] What are this person's top 3 achievements?
- [ ] What specific problems can they solve?
- [ ] What makes them different from other GRC candidates?

**If NO:** Your wins are buried. Move them to the top.

---

## ✅ Top 3 Wins Check

Your resume should lead with these (in order of impact):

**Win #1: Vulnerability Reduction**
- [ ] Appears in first half of page 1
- [ ] Has specific numbers (70,000 → 12,000 or 83% reduction)
- [ ] Shows method (automated remediation workflows)

**Win #2: Automation Achievement**
- [ ] Appears in first half of page 1
- [ ] Has time savings (70% faster) or efficiency gain
- [ ] Shows technical depth (AWS Config, Python, etc.)

**Win #3: Compliance Success**
- [ ] Appears in first half of page 1
- [ ] Has measurable outcome (90%+ compliance, zero findings)
- [ ] Shows scope (7,500+ assets, multiple frameworks)

**If ANY are missing from page 1:** Reorder your bullets NOW.

## ✅ Outcome vs. Responsibility Audit

**Pick 5 random bullets from your resume. For each one, ask:**

Does it start with an outcome or a responsibility?

**❌ Responsibility words:**
- Responsible for...
- Managed...
- Handled...
- Worked on...
- Assisted with...

**✅ Outcome words:**
- Reduced... by X%
- Increased... by X%
- Automated... saving X hours
- Achieved... across X systems
- Built... processing X controls

**Score:** ___/5 bullets are outcome-focused

**Target:** 5/5 (100%)

**If less than 4/5:** Rewrite using the formula:
```
[Action Verb] + [Measurable Outcome] + [Scope] + [Method]
```

---

## ✅ Governance → Engineering Signal

**Count how many bullets show "HOW" vs "WHAT":**

**WHAT (Governance):**
- Ensured compliance with...
- Maintained documentation for...
- Conducted assessments of...
- Reviewed policies for...

**HOW (Engineering):**
- Built AWS Config rules to...
- Automated evidence collection using...
- Engineered Python scripts that...
- Integrated SIEM data with...

**Ratio:** _____ HOW bullets : _____ WHAT bullets

**Target:** At least 40% HOW bullets (shows engineering mindset)

**If too many WHAT bullets:** Add the method/tool to each one.

---

## ✅ Length Check

**Page count:** _____

**Target:**
- [ ] 1 page (if 0-3 years experience) ❌ Not you
- [ ] 2 pages (if 4-10 years experience) ✅ **THIS IS YOU**
- [ ] 3 pages MAX (if 10+ years + leadership)

**If over 2 pages:**
1. Remove bullets from roles 10+ years ago
2. Cut duties everyone in the role does
3. Remove obvious statements
4. Combine similar achievements
5. Cut soft skills without proof

---

## ✅ ATS Keyword Check

**Open a target job description. Count these keywords:**

**In Job Description:**
- NIST: _____
- ISO 27001: _____
- SOC 2: _____
- AWS: _____
- Automation: _____
- Risk: _____
- Compliance: _____

**In Your Resume:**
- NIST: _____
- ISO 27001: _____
- SOC 2: _____
- AWS: _____
- Automation: _____
- Risk: _____
- Compliance: _____

**Match rate:** _____% (should be 80%+)

**If low:** Add keywords naturally in:
- Skills section
- Project bullets
- Achievement descriptions

---

## ✅ Personality & Projects Check

**Does your resume include:**
- [ ] Link to securitybyjp.com (or portfolio)
- [ ] Featured Projects section
- [ ] Recent certifications (CAISS, TAISE)
- [ ] Personal headline or brand statement
- [ ] GitHub or technical work samples

**If missing 3+:** You look like a checkbox auditor, not an engineer.

**Quick fix:**
1. Add website link to header
2. Create "Featured Projects" section
3. List recent certs with dates
4. Add headline: "GRC Engineer | Automation + AWS + NIST RMF"

---

## ✅ The "So What?" Test

**Pick your 3 longest bullets. For each, ask "So what?"**

**Example:**

**Bullet:** "Managed vulnerability scanning across enterprise systems"

**So what?** → "Reduced vulnerabilities by 83% across 10,000+ assets"

**So what?** → "Prevented potential breaches, saved $2M in risk exposure"

**Better bullet:** "Reduced vulnerabilities by 83% across 10,000+ assets through automated remediation, preventing potential breaches and saving $2M in risk exposure"

**Your 3 bullets:**

1. Original: ________________________________
   So what? ________________________________
   Rewrite: ________________________________

2. Original: ________________________________
   So what? ________________________________
   Rewrite: ________________________________

3. Original: ________________________________
   So what? ________________________________
   Rewrite: ________________________________

## ✅ Signal Strength Test

**Show your resume to someone NOT in tech/GRC for 10 seconds.**

**Ask them:**
1. What does this person do?
2. What are they good at?
3. Would you hire them? Why?

**If they can't answer clearly:** Your signal is weak.

**Strengthen it:**
- Lead with your top 3 wins
- Use numbers in every bullet

## 🎯 Remember

**Your resume is a signal, not a biography.**

Every line should make the hiring manager think:
> "This person can solve my problem."

When you lead with wins, show outcomes, and demonstrate the evolution from governance to engineering, that signal becomes impossible to ignore.

**That's when you get the interview.**
