## GRC Resume Best Practices

### For Security Analysts Transitioning to GRC

1. **Reframe security work as GRC**: Instead of "Monitored security alerts," write "Conducted risk assessments and control validation for critical infrastructure"
2. **Emphasize frameworks**: Highlight any work with NIST, ISO, SOX, PCI DSS, even if indirect
3. **Show business impact**: "Reduced audit findings by 40%" beats "Performed security audits"
4. **Include policy work**: Any documentation, procedures, or standards you've created
5. **Highlight cross-functional collaboration**: GRC roles require working with legal, finance, IT

### General Best Practices

1. **Use action verbs**: Led, Developed, Implemented, Conducted, Established, Assessed
2. **Quantify everything**: Include numbers, percentages, and dollar amounts
3. **Mirror job language**: Use exact keywords from job descriptions
4. **Keep it simple**: Avoid tables, graphics, and complex formatting
5. **Two pages max**: For 11 years experience, two pages is appropriate
6. **Standard fonts**: Arial, Calibri, or Times New Roman
