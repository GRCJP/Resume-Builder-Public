### **LinkedIn Post - The Hook**
```
🚯 4 months of job applications. 0 interviews. $80 wasted on a "professional" resume writer.

Then I met AJ, whose feedback on resume strategy changed everything.

Instead of just applying his advice, I built an entire system around it:

🎯 AI Job Matching Engine - Real-time job discovery with ATS scoring
📊 One-Click Resume Tailoring - Auto-enhance resumes for each application  
📋 Application Tracking System - Kanban-style workflow management
🔄 Smart Fallback System - Always shows relevant opportunities

This isn't just a tool - it's everything I wish I had when starting my job search.

Huge shoutout to AJ for the mentorship and the mantra "share the process" - that's why this is open source and free for fellow GRC professionals.

## From Job Seeker to Solution Architect

I built a comprehensive GRC Resume Builder after 4 months of job search frustration. Here's the technical journey:

### 🏗️ Architecture Decisions
- **Next.js + TypeScript** - Production-ready with excellent DX
- **localStorage** - No backend required, instant persistence
- **Multi-board job scraping** - Real-time data with smart fallbacks
- **Error boundary patterns** - Handles browser extension conflicts

### 🧩 Key Challenges Solved
1. **Browser Extension Conflicts** - Crypto wallets crashing the app
2. **API Limitations** - CORS blocking job board requests  
3. **Resume Tailoring Over-Engineering** - AI generating verbose content
4. **Real-Time Discovery** - Manual job searching across boards

### 🎯 Smart Features
- **ATS Optimization** - Industry benchmark comparisons
- **One-Click Tailoring** - Natural keyword integration
- **7-Day Auto-Removal** - Fresh job listings automatically
- **Application Tracking** - Kanban workflow with persistence

### 📚 Built on Proven Strategy
Based on AJ's "Signal, Not Biography" philosophy from GRC Engineering Club.

Every feature addresses real job search pain points I experienced firsthand.

Questions? Feedback? Let's collaborate! The job search is hard enough - we should make the tools better together.
