## Editing Tips

### **When Editing, Focus On:**

1. **Outcome-Focused Bullets**
   - ❌ "Responsible for vulnerability management"
   - ✅ "Reduced vulnerabilities by 83% across 10,000+ assets"

2. **Top 3 Wins First**
   - Lead with your biggest achievements
   - Put them in first half of page 1
   - Make them impossible to miss

3. **Keywords from Job Description**
   - Copy exact terms from job posting
   - Integrate naturally into bullets
   - Don't keyword stuff

4. **Metrics Everywhere**
   - Add numbers to every bullet
   - Show scope (10,000+ assets)
   - Show impact (70% reduction)

5. **Tools and Frameworks**
   - Mention specific tools (AWS Config, Wiz, Qualys)
   - Name frameworks (NIST RMF, SOC 2, ISO 27001)
   - Show technical depth

## Example: Editing Based on Job Analysis

### **Job Description Says:**
"Looking for GRC Engineer with AWS Config, Lambda, and continuous compliance automation experience"

### **Your Resume Currently Says:**
"Managed cloud security compliance programs"

### **Job Analyzer Shows:**
- Match Score: 65%
- Missing: AWS Config, Lambda, continuous compliance, automation

### **You Edit To:**
"Engineered continuous compliance automation using AWS Config, Lambda, and EventBridge, reducing manual evidence collection by 70% and enabling real-time drift detection"

### **Re-Analyze:**
- Match Score: 92%
- Missing: (minimal)
- Result: Much better match!
