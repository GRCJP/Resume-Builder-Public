🚯 4 months of job applications. 0 interviews. $80 wasted on a "professional" resume writer.

Then I met AJ, whose feedback on resume strategy changed everything.

Instead of just applying his advice, I built an entire system around it:

🎯 AI Job Matching Engine - Real-time job discovery with ATS scoring
📊 One-Click Resume Tailoring - Auto-enhance resumes for each application  
📋 Application Tracking System - Kanban-style workflow management
🔄 Smart Fallback System - Always shows relevant opportunities

This isn't just a tool - it's everything I wish I had when starting my job search.

Huge shoutout to AJ for the mentorship and the mantra "share the process" - that's why this is open source and free for fellow GRC professionals.
