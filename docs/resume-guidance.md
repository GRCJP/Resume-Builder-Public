# How to Build a Resume That Opens Doors
*By AJ - GRC Engineering Club*

This guidance is the foundation of the GRC Resume Builder. Every feature was built around these principles.

## The Resume Isn't a Biography, It's a Signal

Most members start with resumes that tell their entire career story. The problem:

**Hiring managers spend an average of 7–10 seconds on a first pass.** Your goal isn't to tell everything, it's to send the right signal in that short window. Focus each bullet and section around clarity, alignment, and measurable impact. Every line should make the reader say, "this person can solve my problem."

## Lead With Wins That Match the Role

We look for the top three "wins" that define your story: things you should never downplay or bury. Examples:

- Driving a 90% reduction in open vulnerabilities
- Automating control testing using AWS Config or Python
- Building testing and automation frameworks for ISO 27001 or SOC 2 readiness

Highlight these wins early, especially if they align with your target job. They create immediate credibility and serve as anchors for the rest of your story.

## Shift from Responsibilities to Outcomes

The biggest difference between a solid resume and a great one is outcome framing. Instead of writing:

```
Responsible for leading vulnerability management efforts across the enterprise.
```

Write:

```
Reduced open vulnerabilities by 78% across 10,000+ assets through automated remediation workflows.
```

**Outcomes quantify your scope and prove value.** They turn a list of duties into a record of results.

## Show the Evolution From Governance to Engineering

If you're moving toward GRC Engineering roles, your resume should reflect that transition. The shift is simple:

- **Governance →** what needs to happen
- **Engineering →** how it gets done

You can make that visible by integrating your learning path and tools directly into the resume. Example:

```
Currently training in AWS Cloud and Python automation to expand control monitoring and evidence collection capabilities.
```

It signals forward momentum and technical curiosity, which recruiters and hiring managers love.

## Cut the Fluff: Three Pages Max

Length is one of the most frequent issues. Federal and government resumes often stretch beyond five pages, but private-sector hiring doesn't work that way anymore.

Aim for:
- **1 page:** early career or first GRC role
- **2 pages:** mid-career with measurable results  
- **3 pages (max):** senior professionals or hybrid leadership roles

Every extra paragraph is an opportunity for someone to lose focus. Prioritize what reinforces your brand and cut what doesn't.

## Align Keywords With Your Target Role

Applicant tracking systems (ATS) and recruiters both scan for the right keywords. Read the job posting carefully and make sure those terms appear naturally in your resume.

Common GRC keywords include:
- ISO 27001, SOC 2, NIST CSF, PCI DSS
- AWS, Python, automation
- Control monitoring, risk management, audit readiness

The easiest place to insert them is in project bullets or your "Skills" section.

## Don't Hide Your Personality or Projects

If you've built a lab, portfolio, or blog: link it. Real projects demonstrate initiative and technical proof. They separate GRC Engineers from checkbox auditors.

A short personal headline also helps. Example:

```
GRC Engineer focused on automation, AWS compliance, and evidence collection efficiency.
```

## Your Resume is Your First Engineering Deliverable

It's proof that you can communicate complex work clearly and deliver measurable outcomes.

When hiring managers read a resume that's clear, concise, and focused on results, it tells them you'll bring that same precision to their organization.
