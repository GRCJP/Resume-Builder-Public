# 🚀 Slack Announcement: GRC Resume Builder - Community Edition

## 📝 **Why I Built This**

As a GRC professional, I was frustrated with the job search process. Resumes weren't optimized for ATS systems, job discovery was scattered across dozens of boards, and tracking applications was a mess. I spent hours manually searching, tailoring resumes, and losing opportunities to technical issues.

**The problem:** GRC job searching is broken - it's chaotic, inefficient, and misses great opportunities.

**My solution:** Build a free, open-source tool that transforms GRC job searching from guesswork into engineering.
